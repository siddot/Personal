                Let's start from the deep... When I was 14 years old I was doing easy tasks on freelance. 
                It was not long story because after half of month or a bit longer 
                I understood that this way of earning money is very hard and boring because
                people don't trust you. I did may be 3-4 tasks. I did bots for telegram and parsers.  
            </p>
            <p className="abzats">

                Then I tried to create different web and mobile applications and I thought I could create startup. 
                Some of applications I put on Google Play Market. My friends played them and then after som time I decided to delete them because I realized one day that they weren't good at all:) 
                I stopped loving them at all)) 
                So, after one year of doing some shitty projects I understood many things and many concepts, I got experience but didn't get good result but is is not a problem because now I know more and I can use my knowledge in a better way. 
            </p>
            <p className="abzats">
                After that (in autumn 2021) I decided to dive in NFTs, Crypto. I am still learning new things about crypto, I read many articles. So                 
                For 9 months I tried to understand crypto. I received whitelists, bought cryptocurrency, studied how the blockchain works, and did research on many projects. Participated in airdrops, testnets and freemints. In general, I did everything in order to broaden my horizons in the field of cryptocurrencies. During this time I tried a lot of things, naturally I invested money and naturally there were many unsuccessful contributions to scam projects. I read probably 80% of the articles on Binance Academy and not only there.

                This summer, day and night, for 3 months, I gathered precisely in order to implement projects in web3. I learned a lot, I watched a lot of videos on this topic. I also took courses, but it seems to me that it is very productive to do some projects and plan to watch courses. View portfolio by simply scrolling below

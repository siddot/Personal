            <p className="about-me">
            &#128421; Of course, first is coding. I love to learn new about programming. For me, coding is like magic in real world and I love to conjure:)
            </p>
            <p>&#127936; Apart from coding I love to spend time outdoors. I love to play basketball sometimes.</p>
            <p>&#127929; Also I love to make music. When I have inspiration or when I am sad or when I did all things I planned for day I sit down at the computer and start making beats. It's just for me to develop and creatively too. I love music</p>
